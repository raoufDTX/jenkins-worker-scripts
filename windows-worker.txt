JENKINS WINDOWS WORKER
======================

Spawn a win2k8 r2 x64 instance on the vpc private subnet with the jenkins
ssh key. During instance creation set a larger than default root size, say
50GB. You'll need it.

Decrypt the default windows  password using the EC2 console and jenkins
private key.

Ssh into the jenkins master with an ssh tunnel to the slave's private IP
on port 3389.

Connect to the local end with rdesktop or Remote Desktop Client, eg localhost:3399 if you used ssh -L 3399:10.0.1.x:3389 ...

Log in as Administrator with the password you decrypted.

Open Control panel, search for internet options. In the security tab, 
disable Internet Explorer Protected Mode. Otherwise you won't be able
to get anything done, and this box is a dev workstation not a server.
